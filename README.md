# Alundra Preservation Project

> Preserving the history and legacy of the PS1 classic Alundra

The purpose of this repository is to gather anything notable that is in any shape or form tied to the game, such as;

- Original assets
- Marketing material
- Prints/flyers
- Online/magazine articles
- Fan content
- Anything, really.

The initiative is still young and might not grow as fast as one could like, but hey - at least I'm trying. ðŸ™ƒ

## What Is Gathered So Far?

### OST

#### 1:1 MIDI and Soundfonts From Alundra

I've ripped 3 SEQ, that are used to playback the game's in-game music and converted them to MIDI files, as well as their respective soundfonts. These are virtually 1:1 conversions of the game's OST, that one could possibly use to make re-arrangments or remixes from. You can browse the files from the [`OST` directory](/ost).

### Fan Content

#### Alundra Sega Port/Clone Fan Effort

So far, I've written a quick synopsis of one programmer's attempt to create an Alundra engine for the Sega Saturn system using the original assets from the PS1 game. This incredible effort was documented by the programmer themself on a sega fan bulletin board known as "segaextreme". Unfortunately nothing new has been shared for a long while.

You can read this piece as well as see a couple of the screenshots from this initiative by [navigating to the `fan-content/sega-port` directory](./fan-content/sega-port)
